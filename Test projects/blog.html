      <p class="w3-large">Aqua C&D is a water refilling station that is located in Mountain View, Balibago, Angeles City.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">Aqua C&D is I can recommend to anyone because it's trusted and its guaranteed that it has a clean filtration to their water tanks.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">The first time I tasted their product it was so refreshing at don't have an after taste after you drink it because the other water refilling station have those after taste in their water. So anyone who will read this blog, I recommend this water station, it has some freebies, if you purchase worth of 3000 Pesos you will have some freebies from them.</p> <p>Tags:Water Station, Mineral Water, Aqua C&D</p>
